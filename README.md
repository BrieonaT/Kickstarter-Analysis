# Kickstarting with Excel
 
## Overview of Project
In Module One, the task assigned was to help Louise, a playwright looking to fund her upcoming play, Fever, using Kickstarter. This is her first fundraiser, so she asked for help in planning a Kickstarter using Excel. The task is to help Louise prepare her play and analyze other campaigns and see where they were successful and monitor any trends that come up.
### Purpose
The purpose of the assignment is to familiarize ourselves with Excel and it's range of functions using a real-world example. By doing this, we have become acquainted with some of Excel's main functions, such as creating columns, organizing columns, creating pivot charts, creating seperate sheets and extracting information and learning how to make graphs to chart our findings.
 
 
 
## Analysis and Challenges
    
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
An analysis was done to determine which months of the year it was better to launch a Kickstarter on. Data was collected counting up the number of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns, and then plotted onto a line chart. The data shown in this research suggests the best time to launch a Kickstarter for a play would be in May. The data on the chart below shows that May had the highest number of successful play campaigns, with 111 successful campaigns launched during that time. The data presented would also suggest that December would be the worst month to launch a campaign for a play, with only 37 successful plays launched during that time and 35 failed plays.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 
There was also an analysis done to determine which goal amounts were most likely to reach their funding.  Data was collected on which amounts, from less than 1,000$ to over 50,000$ and in increments of 5,000$, between had the highest rate of success. This was done by charting both a solid number of campaigns along with putting those numbers into percentages. The data this showed suggests that overall, lower goals had a higher success rate. This is evident in the fact campaigns with goals less than 1,000 had a success rate of 75.81% over 186 campaigns, along with campaigns that had goals between 1,000$ and 4,999$ had a success rate of 72.66% over 534 campaigns. While the chart also shows that higher goals in campaigns can have a decent sucess rate, such as campaigns between the 35,000$ to 39,999$ and 40,000$ to 44,999$ goal ranges both having a success rate of 66.67%, you also need to account for the fact that their number of projects were respectfully 6 and 3.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I faced a few different challenges during this project. The bulk of the challenges I faced were during the second deliverable. This included figuring out how to perform the COUNTIFS function. It took me a lot of trial and error to get it down, but in the end after working through it for a few hours, I fixed my errors and had it running smoothly. This included realizing that I was using data from the wrong column, the amount pledged instead of the goal, and hence why my line chart initially looked off. I usually took breaks when I had issues, then came back later and re-watched the videos and re-read the accompanying guides and figured out my mistakes.
 
 
## Results
 
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

One conclusion that can be drawn about the Outcomes based on Launch date is that it's suggested that it's better to start a Kickstarter campaign in May, given that it has the highest success rate out of all the months. Another conclusion is that the data suggests that it's not a good idea to start a campaign in December, given it has the lowest success rate. 
 
 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

A conclusion you can make based on the data for Outcomes based on Goals is that the lower your goal is, seemingly the better chance of success is. In addition, you can draw a conclusion based on the data is that the higher your goal is, you have an overall lower chance of a successfully funded campaign.
 
 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

There are a few limitations of the given data set. One limitation is the size of data. While the sample set is large, you can see in charts such as Outcomes based on Goals that there's less information for plays of higher goal ranges compared to smaller goal ranges. 
 
 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? 

There are other possible tables and graphs you could create for a deeper understanding of trends within this data. You could specify success rates depending on what countries the Kickstarter is based in. Another possibility is you can create a graph that would measure the duration of Kickstarters to how successful they were. You could also use the columns of Spotlight and Staff Pick to see if either of those had any effect on the rates of whether a Kickstarter became successful or not.
